Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
And come with naked swords.
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
And the great care of goods at random left
AEMELIA

And strike you home without a messenger.

Without addition or diminishing,

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Go back again, and be new beaten home?

Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;

OF SYRACUSE

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

And will not lightly trust the messenger



It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,

If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,

OF EPHESUS

There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought

ANTIPHOLUS

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

Exit

What observation madest thou in this case

And never rise until my tears and prayers

Where France?

OF SYRACUSE

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
